                As I mentioned before, programming is one of my favorite hobbies. Video games are my favorite thing to mess around with when it
                comes to programming. I actually began to teach myself Java so that I could make my own games which is how I started coding. 
                The process of starting from scratch on a project to seeing the final product is always the best feeling ever. This is why
                I've also wanted to develop software professionally.

              <p class="card-text">
                One of my other favorite hobbies is sewing. I like sewing for the same reason I like programming, starting from scratch and ending
                up with a completely custom product. One advantage with sewing is that you have a little for freedom to make mistakes without them
                being too detrimental to your project. This makes it less of a problem solving activity and a bit more relaxing which is nice. This
                is a picture of the first reupholstery project I ever did. However, I started sewing to make my own shirts.

              <p class="card-text">
                I started skating around the same time that I started programming but after a while I stopped for a few years. Just recently however,
                I got back into it. Whenever I feel like i've been stuck inside for too long, it's nice to go outside and skate for a while. The picture 
                here is of the first time I did a back-side boardslide. This was a huge accomplishment for me and made me feel like I was getting a 
                lot better.

                As much as I like to make games, I also like playing them. The games i've spent the most time play are Minecraft, Rocket League, Fortnite,
                and most recently Valorant. The picture here is of the character that I use most in Valorant, Raze. I have a love hate relationship with
                this game because as much fun it is to play, it's really hard to rank up.
